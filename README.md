# Chat Application and Website

## Abstract:
The chat application and website project aims to create a real-time messaging platform that enables users to communicate with each other via text messages. The project will use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack to develop the application and website.

The chat application and website will have features such as user registration and login, profile management, and a messaging system that allows users to create and join chat rooms. Users will be able to send messages to other users in real-time and will receive notifications for new messages.

## Software Requirements:
The chat application and website will be developed using the MERN stack, which consists of the following software requirements:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores user data, chat room information, and messages.

Express.js: A web application framework that provides a server-side infrastructure for the application.

React.js: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface of the application and website.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that enables running the application on the server-side.

Socket.io: A library used to establish real-time communication between the client and server, which will be used for messaging functionality.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard used for secure authentication and authorization of users.

Git: A version control system that allows tracking changes made to the codebase.

Heroku: A cloud-based platform used for hosting the application and website.

Overall, the chat application and website project will use a combination of these software requirements to create a real-time messaging platform using the MERN stack.
